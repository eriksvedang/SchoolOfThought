      <h1>Tempest (a temporary title of this project)</h1>

      <h2>Hello!</h2>
      <p>
        This website is an ongoing project for providing a series of exercises for people interested in functional programming. In particular it's designed for those who want to understand how to apply deep and interesting concepts from mathematics when solving practical problems.
      </p>      
      <p>
       Advanced articles about functional programming often use a lot of peculiar words &ndash; <span class="jargon">Profunctor</span>, <span class="jargon">Monoid</span> and <span class="jargon">Arrow</span>, just to name a few. Learning about their mathematical properties can be a lot of fun, but how should they be used in actual code? Without a practical understanding it's hard to recognize the patterns and situations where they are helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully the exercises here can help in that regard! Or if you think they're lacking, please help us out by making a pull request. The code for this website can be found <a href="https://github.com/eriksvedang/Tempest">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>
        You need to know a bit of Haskell to really make use of this site. If you'll try to solve the exercises with some other language like Ocaml, F#, Lisp, etc, you will hopefully get something good out of it but things are going to diverge at one point or another.

        <!-- If you understand the following code snippet, you're probably good to go:</p> -->
              
      <!-- <pre> -->
      <!--   <code class="haskell"> -->
      <!--     main :: IO () -->
      <!--     main = do -->
      <!--       putStrLn "hello" -->

      <!--     fib :: Int -> Int -->
      <!--     fib 0 = 1 -->
      <!--     fib 1 = 1 -->
      <!--     fib n = fib (n - 2) + fib (n - 1) -->
      <!--   </code> -->
      <!-- </pre> -->

      <p>
        Also make sure you have a good way of setting up small projects (one interactive file for each exercise should be fine).
      </p>

      <h2>Chapters</h2>
      <p>It's probably a good idea to go through these in order, but who are we to stop you?</p>
